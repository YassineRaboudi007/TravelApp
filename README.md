# Demo Version - Sabre API Integration Web App

## Overview

This is a demo version of a Web Application that integrates with the Sabre API, demonstrating basic functionality and providing a platform for future development.

## Key Highlights

1. **Integration**: Integrated with Sabre API to showcase the functionalities of the platform.
   
2. **Web Application**: I chose to create a Web App instead of a console application to better showcase my technical expertise and give you a more comprehensive assessment field.

3. **No Initial Setup Needed**: The application is ready to run as-is. No initial setup or configuration is required.

4. **Simple Architecture**: 
   - Given the small scope of this demo, I opted for a straightforward and efficient architecture.
   - This quick and clean approach allows for easy understanding and scalability of the codebase.

## Features

- Seamless integration with Sabre API
- Comments for major improvements available in the codebase
- Demonstration of foundational scalability

## Scalability & Future Enhancements

Although the current scope is limited, the demo is built with scalability in mind:

1. **Orchestrator Services**:
   - To integrate other APIs easily, comments have been added in relevant sections of the code indicating where an orchestrator service can be included.

2. **Caching Layer**:
   - A caching mechanism can be added to store recent queries.
   - Custom invalidation logic can also be implemented to ensure data freshness and consistency.

## Notes for Reviewers

- The architecture is intentionally kept simple due to the limited scope of this demo.
- Clean Architecture or Domain-Driven Design patterns were not implemented to keep the demo swift and basic.
- Major improvement points are commented on in the source code, focusing on areas for orchestration and caching.

## Running the Application

Simply open the solution in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio) and start the application. The demo is configured to run without any additional setup.
